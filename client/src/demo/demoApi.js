// A drop-in, client-only stand-in for `../api.js`, used for the static
// GitHub Pages build (see vite.config.js / VITE_DEMO_MODE). There's no
// server to talk to on Pages - so instead of fetch() calls, every method
// here runs the same logic as the real Express routes in
// server/src/index.js directly against an in-memory copy of the seeded demo
// dataset (client/src/demo/demoData.json).
